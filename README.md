# EXPENSE TRACKER

This is an expese tracker website built using React JS. I created this website as a part of my learning journey.
It includes:
* A dynamic list which will hold your expenses and display it in a clean way.
* You can add expenses easily and can filter out the expenses by the year.
* The Chart shows the summary of all your expenses in a visual manner to understand your spendings.


# How to run:
1. Run npm -i
2. Run npm start

# Bugs to fix
* The filter is hard coded to the year. Have to add functionality to automatically detect the year from the expenses list.
